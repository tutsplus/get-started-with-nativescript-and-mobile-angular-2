## Instructor: [Reggie Dawson][instructor url]


Writing cross-platform mobile apps is hard. On one hand, it can save money to use a JavaScript-based cross-platform mobile framework. But on the other hand, we'd like to be able to give app users the speed and elegance of a native app.

Well, NativeScript is a cross-platform mobile framework that lets us have the best of both worlds. With NativeScript, we can write apps using the web technologies we know and love: CSS, ES6, and even frameworks like Angular 2.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will teach you how to build a cross-platform native app with NativeScript and Angular 2. You'll get to try out the TypeScript language and you'll learn how Angular 2 and NativeScript can work together. You'll get to try out some of the most important NativeScript components—like buttons and activity bars that render with native Android and iOS components—as well as how to connect NativeScript with Angular 2 concepts like routing. And by the time you've finished, you'll have built a simple but functional native app, with a Firebase back-end.
